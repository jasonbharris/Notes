* HTML

HTML, the backbone of the web. You will not find a website, application, or a front-end framework or library like Angular or React that does not have HTML built in.

Hello, my name is Jason and in this HTML master class we will learn everything their is to know about HTML. Then at the end, we will create a project with your new knowledge and see how HTML returns a web page.

Welcome to front-end development if you are just beginning, and if you are here as a refresher; thanks for choosing me so let's get developing.

What is HTML anyway?

HTML or HyperText Markup Language, for one is not a programming language. HTML lays out the content of the webpage depicting where everything will live.
As stated earlier, it is the backbone of the web and without content there is no web page. So, you can say that HTML organizes the content that will be displayed on the web page.

So, how does HTML organize content?

HTML utilizes tags which are elements that provide meaning to the content in relation to where each bit of content is supposed to be in the scheme of the web page. By using "<" and ">" the tag goes in between the two creating the element. Let's go to our text editor of choice to get an example of an element within HTML.

Before we can even get into the code we have to inform the browser, in which the browser is what you usually consume the web like Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc., of the type of document we are creating. That is done by the following:
<DOCTYPE html>. That tells the browser that whatever follows that will be HTML and will know how to return the information correctly and provide the web page to the user.

Answer
Here is a simpler explanation of HTML that a fifth grader could understand:
What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the special language that is used to create websites and web pages.

1. Consistency
HTML helps make sure that web pages look the same across different computers and devices.
2. Accessibility
HTML tags help make web pages easier for people with disabilities to understand and use.
3. Search Engines

How I plan on making a good web development video is the following
 -Create what I plan on doing prior to making the video, saving the
  images and everything on Github
 -Create the video and edit it, while at the same time make video of myself
 -Load the video on YouTube after editing it and scheduling a good time to
  releasing it
